7. Conclusion

In this lesson we learned how to use templates at a basic level. We covered function and class templates, 
non type templates, and template specialization. We also learned how the compiler interprets and compilers
templated functions and classes. 

If you want to learn more in depth about templates, I recommend going through the book
C++ Templates: The complete guide (2nd edition).
The book covers pretty much everything you will ever need to know about templates, so I would take it slowly.

No assignment for this lesson :^)
