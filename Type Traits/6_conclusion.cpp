6. Conclusion and assignment

/*
As we have seen, type traits are a very powerful tool when it comes to generic programming. For this assignment,
you will have to create a few type traits like the ones in the STL. 

Type traits you have to implement are:
std::is_array<T>
std::is_const<T>

A few more challenging ones to try are std::conditional<bool, T, U> or std::common_type<T, U>.
