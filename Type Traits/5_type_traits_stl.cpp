5. Type traits and the STL

*/

/*
The STL provides many type traits for you already. It also relies heavily on type traits in the implementation
of some classes, for example std::string uses a char_traits<CharT> class as mentioned earlier. For a full
list of STL type traits, see
http://cppreference.com/reference/en/cpp/types
